Since a TWILIO trial account only allows one and only one number to text it,
Rotten Response's cellular messaging capabilities are unable to be tested

HOWEVER!

You can still test Rotten Response's ability to fetch RT critic scores.

to do so, simply comment these two lines [lines 34 and 35 respectively] like so:

#app = cherrypy.tree.mount(rottenResponse(), "/")
#wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler().run(app)

and then uncomment lines 38 and 39 so you have:

app = cherrypy.tree.mount(rottenResponse(), "/")
cherrypy.quickstart(app)

Next, run the python program. You should see some output regarding BUS ENGINE and whatnot.
That's fine, it's just cherrypy interfacing with HTTP.

Let's say you want to see the rating for the movie "Fight Club." With IDLE still running
rottenresponse.py, point your web browser to 

http://localhost:8080/?Body=Fight Club

The rating (81) will be displayed in plain text. To search for another movie, simply
edit the ?Body= query 

examples

http://localhost:8080/?Body=Life of Brian [will result in "96"]
http://localhost:8080/?Body=The Lion King [will result in "92"]
etc
